## Architecture Overview

**â¬œ CloudFire ðŸŸ§** is built on a robust and flexible architecture centered around the **Entity-Component-System (ECS)** paradigm. This design ensures modularity, scalability, and efficient management of game entities, facilitating future enhancements and aspirations to transition this project into a fully-fledged general-purpose game engine one day.

### Core Components

- **Entity-Component-System (ECS):**

An **[Entity-Component-System (ECS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system)** is a game architecture pattern that organizes entities, their data (components), and the logic (systems) that operates on them, promoting modularity and flexibility. The game loop acts like a heartbeat, driving systems to update entities in an efficient and organized manner.

- **Entities:** Represent game objects (e.g., player, platforms) identified by unique IDs.
- **Components:** Hold data relevant to entities (e.g., [`Position`](https://github.com/JamesGelok/cloudfire/blob/master/src/components/Position.h), [`Velocity`](https://github.com/JamesGelok/cloudfire/blob/master/src/components/Velocity.h), [`Renderable`](https://github.com/JamesGelok/cloudfire/blob/master/src/components/Renderable.h), [etc](https://github.com/JamesGelok/cloudfire/tree/master/src/components)).
- **Systems:** Contain the logic and behavior, operating on entities that possess specific components (e.g., [`RenderSystem`](https://github.com/JamesGelok/cloudfire/blob/master/src/systems/RenderSystem.h), [`PhysicsSystem`](https://github.com/JamesGelok/cloudfire/blob/master/src/systems/PhysicsSystem.h), [etc](https://github.com/JamesGelok/cloudfire/tree/master/src/systems)).

There are also **Managers** that oversee game logic and data management, such as the **EntityManager** and **ComponentManager**, which handle entity creation/destruction and component storage/retrieval, respectively.

### Some key features of the architecture include:

- **Component Masking with IDs:**

  - Uses a bitmask where each bit represents the presence of a specific component in an entity, allowing systems to quickly determine which entities to process based on their assigned components.

- **Rendering System:**

  - Built using OpenGL, the rendering system manages shaders, projection matrices, and lighting configurations to render 3D models. [RenderSystem](https://github.com/JamesGelok/cloudfire/blob/master/src/systems/RenderSystem.cpp)
  - **Shaders:** Simple custom vertex and fragment shaders handle transformations and lighting. [Shaders](https://github.com/JamesGelok/cloudfire/tree/master/shaders)

- **Model Loading:**
  - Utilizes **Assimp** to load 3D models, with a custom [`ModelLoader`](https://github.com/JamesGelok/cloudfire/blob/master/src/components/ModelLoader.cpp) made to eventually handle model with textures.

### Managers

The ECS framework in **CloudFire ðŸŸ§** ensures a clear separation between data and behavior:

1. **[EntityManager](https://github.com/JamesGelok/cloudfire/blob/master/src/core/Entity.h):** Manages the creation and destruction of entities, maintaining a pool of available entity IDs and tracking component associations using bitmasking.

2. **[ComponentManager](https://github.com/JamesGelok/cloudfire/blob/master/src/managers/ComponentManager.h):** Handles the storage and retrieval of components, utilizing templates for efficient access and modification of different component types.

## Building and Running the Game

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- **C++17 Compiler:** Compatible with C++17 standards (e.g., `g++`, `clang++`).
- **GLFW:** For window creation and input handling.
- **GLAD:** For managing OpenGL function pointers.
- **Assimp:** For loading 3D models.
- **stb Libraries:** For image loading (textures).
- **GLM:** For mathematical operations (vectors, matrices, quaternions).

### Installation of Dependencies (macOS)

Since the project has been primarily tested on macOS, here are the installation steps using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
# Install Homebrew if not already installed
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install dependencies
brew install glfw assimp glm
```

### Compilation

The project currently uses a `Makefile` for compilation. To compile the project:

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd path/to/CloudFire
   ```

2. **Run Make:**

   ```bash
   make
   ```

   This command compiles the source files and links them to create the executable.

### Running the Game

After successful compilation, run the executable:

```bash
./main
```

### Current Platform Support

**â¬œ CloudFire ðŸŸ§** has been thoroughly tested on **macOS**. While it should function on other platforms with minor adjustments, comprehensive testing on Windows and Linux is pending.

### Future Platform Plans

To enhance cross-platform compatibility and streamline the build process, we plan to transition from `Makefile` to **CMake**. This will facilitate easier compilation across different operating systems and environments.

## Testing and Quality Assurance

### Current Testing

- **Platform:** The game has been thoroughly tested on **macOS**, ensuring stability and performance on this platform.
- **Functionality:** Core gameplay mechanics, rendering, and input systems have been validated to work seamlessly.
- **Performance:** The game maintains a high frame rate and smooth gameplay experience.

### Planned Testing

- **Cross-Platform Testing:** Extend testing to **Windows** and **Linux** to ensure compatibility and address platform-specific issues.
- **Automated Testing:** Implement automated tests for critical systems to maintain code quality and detect regressions early.
- **Performance Profiling:** Continuously profile the game to identify and optimize performance bottlenecks, ensuring smooth gameplay even as the engine scales.
- **User Testing:** Conduct user testing sessions to gather feedback on gameplay mechanics, controls, and overall user experience, guiding iterative improvements.

## Future Aspirations

While **CloudFire ðŸŸ§** currently serves as a functional 3D platformer, we aspire to evolve it into a comprehensive, general-purpose game engine. Future enhancements include:

- **Cross-Platform Support:** Migrating the build system from `Makefile` to **CMake** for improved cross-platform support and easier build configurations, and testing on Windows and Linux.
- **Enhanced ECS Framework:** Expanding the Entity-Component-System to support more complex game mechanics and systems.
- **Advanced Rendering Features:** Integrating sophisticated shaders, shadow mapping, and particle systems to elevate visual fidelity.
- **Networking and Multiplayer:** Introducing multiplayer capabilities to allow real-time player interactions.
- **Project Separation:** Splitting the project into two distinct repositoriesâ€”one for the game and another for the underlying game engineâ€”to promote reusability and independent development.
- **Advanced Physics Integration:** Incorporating more sophisticated physics simulations to enhance realism and interactivity.
